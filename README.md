# E1S - Easily Manage AWS ECS Resources in Terminal 🐱✨

`e1s` is a terminal application to easily browsing and manage AWS ECS resources, with a focus on [Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate). Inspired by [k9s](https://github.com/derailed/k9s).

## Note

e1s reads your ~/.aws/config file, but it does not store or send your access and secret key anywhere. The access and secret key is used only to securely connect to AWS API via AWS SDK.

## Installation

e1s is available on Linux, macOS and Windows platforms.

- Binaries for Linux, Windows and Mac are available in the [release](https://github.com/keidarcy/e1s/releases) page.
